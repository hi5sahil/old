How the beautiful game of football propogated throughout the world?

So, I am a bit of 'Sleepless in Seattle' on Saturday morning and really excited for the world cup which is going to kick-off next week on June 14th.

To get in the mood for the upcoming month, I found myself a dataset with all the international football matches ever played since the 1872 friendly between England vs Scotland which was held in Glasgow.

In the below geo plot, count of matches corresponds to size of circle which becomes darker as years go by giving us a sense of how the game of football became popular across the world!
